    <h1>Stack Hardening Essentials</h1>
    <section class="detail">
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Deep observability.</strong> Wire OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, plus Sentry for front-end whoopsies—so you spot a 500 before a client screenshots it.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature flags &amp; kill switches.</strong> Drop LaunchDarkly (or a home-grown Redis toggle) between code and prod; that way you can gate a half-baked module instead of rolling back the whole release at 2 a.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Secrets &amp; keys.</strong> Park every credential in HashiCorp Vault or AWS KMS, with auto-rotation and short TTLs; no .env leak should put dollars at risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Infrastructure as code.</strong> Terraform scripts (plus a locked state backend) make sure every subnet, IAM role, and WAF rule is traceable—good luck passing a SOC-2 audit without it.</li>
        <li><strong>Pen-testing pipeline.</strong> Bolt OWASP ZAP and Snyk into CI so each build ships with a vuln report; run quarterly red-team drills for the stuff scanners miss.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup &amp; disaster drills.</strong> Nightly logical dumps, hourly WAL shipping, and cross-region replicas; run a game-day so the team proves they can restore in under one hour.</li>
        <li><strong>GDPR/CCPA data-governance hooks.</strong> Fine-grained retention buckets, “right-to-be-forgotten” jobs, and an admin UI to export personal data in one click—because fines hurt more than dev hours.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility &amp; localization.</strong> WCAG-AA color contrast, keyboard nav, screen-reader labels, and an i18n pipeline so you can flip to Arabic or Japanese once the growth team screams for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobile wrappers.</strong> Use Capacitor or React Native shells that talk to the same GraphQL endpoint, giving investors a slick “approve deal” tap while stuck in a taxi.</li>
        <li><strong>Real-time compliance analytics.</strong> A ClickHouse-powered console that shows KYC pass/fail trends, sanction hits, and geo-heatmaps—so risk officers quit begging for Excel dumps.</li>
        <li><strong>API rate-limits &amp; abuse watch.</strong> Envoy filters plus a token bucket cache keep scrapers from nuking your search cluster, and ban rules auto-trigger once anomaly scores spike.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware security modules.</strong> Store root TLS keys and wallet-signing keys in an HSM (CloudHSM or Nitro enclave) so even an insider with sudo can’t swipe them.</li>
        <li><strong>Post-trade reporting.</strong> Auto-generate XBRL or CSV feeds for regulators, and let CFOs schedule them—nobody enjoys 3 a.m. manual compilations.</li>
        <li><strong>AI-driven scoring.</strong> A lightweight Python micro-service (behind the same auth wall) that drops a probability-of-default tag on each deal; helps juniors zero in on red flags fast.</li>
        <li><strong>Service-level objectives.</strong> Define SLA/SLOs in plain text, back them with alert rules, then tick them off in every quarterly board deck—nothing screams credibility louder than uptime stats.</li>
      </ol>
