      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>We build complete funding programs for energy, infrastructure, and industrial projects from USD 20 million upward. Our scope covers feasibility review, risk allocation, offtake validation, and lender roadshows. Debt tenors stretch 7–15 years; coverage ratios are negotiated case by case.</p>
      <h2>Typical assets</h2>
      <p>Solar or wind parks, mid-stream logistics, waste-to-energy, data centres, ports.</p>
      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>Projects fail when capital comes piecemeal. We align sponsors, contractors, and lenders behind a single credit story and lock pricing before EPC mobilises.</p>
      <h2>Next step</h2>
      <p>Provide your financial model and permits list. We’ll flag gaps and outline a funding timeline within five business days.</p>
