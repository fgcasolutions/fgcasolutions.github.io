    <h1>Structured Trade &amp; Commodity Finance</h1>
    <section class="detail">
      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>We arrange short- to mid-term credit for live commodity flows—oil, metals, agri, and everything in between. Deals start at USD 5 million and are anchored by verifiable purchase contracts, receivables, or inventory. Our team packages each transaction, locks in collateral controls, and lines up private credit funds, trade banks, and insurers that move inside 45 days.</p>
      <h2>Typical structures</h2>
      <p>Pre-export finance, borrowing-base lines, receivables discounting, LC back-to-back funding, performance bonds.</p>
      <h2>Why it matters</h2>
      <p>Miss a shipment window and profit evaporates. We keep cargo moving and counterparties calm.</p>
      <h2>Next step</h2>
      <p>Send the draft contract or pro-forma invoice. We’ll return an indicative term sheet in 72 hours.</p>
